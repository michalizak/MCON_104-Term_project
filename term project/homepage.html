<h1>About Us</h1>
<p><strong>Shoe Stop</strong> was created by a young girl with a dream. Michelle, the dreamer, a teacher by trade,
had a creative side that very few people knew about.
She dreamt of finding an outlet for her creativity,
while still being able to help her students fulfill their own dreams.</p>
<p>Armed with a love of business and a passion for style, the teacher became a student.
She found herself a factory and a customer, and in 2015, Shoe Stop Inc. was born.
She works tirelessly every season, personally picking patterns and styles,and
traveling overseas to ensure that her fabrics are just right</p>
<p>You can Shop on Shoe Stop from the comfort of your own home, anywhere.</p>
